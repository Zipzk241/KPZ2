# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Description

This is a full-featured desktop application of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, developed in **Java** using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
The game offers modes for **Player vs Player** and **Player vs Computer** gameplay. 
Game results are saved to a local **file**, and users can view overall statistics.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface** built using **JavaFX**
- Game Modes:
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs Computer (AI using Minimax algorithm)
- Data Persistence:
  - Game history (date, players, result) is saved to a `.csv` file
- Statistics:
  - View win/loss/draw statistics
- Restart game without restarting the application
- Clean and user-friendly UI with responsive layout
- Unit-tested game logic (separated from UI)
